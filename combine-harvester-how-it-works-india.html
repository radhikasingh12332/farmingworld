    <h1>Combine Harvester: What It Is and How It Works</h1>
    <p>
      A <strong>Combine Harvester</strong> is one of the most practical machines in modern farming. For farmers who grow crops like wheat,
      paddy, soybean, maize, or pulses, this single machine can replace days of manual labour and multiple separate operations.
      From what I’ve seen across Indian harvesting seasons, the biggest advantage isn’t just speed—it’s control: you finish on time,
      reduce losses, and keep grain quality consistent.

    <h2>What Is a Combine Harvester?</h2>
    <p>
      A combine harvester is a self-propelled <strong>combine machine</strong> that performs three major harvesting tasks in one continuous operation:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Cutting</strong> the standing crop</li>
      <li><strong>Threshing</strong> the grain from the crop</li>
      <li><strong>Cleaning</strong> the grain by removing chaff and light impurities</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Earlier, these steps were done separately—first harvesting, then threshing on the farmyard, and finally cleaning.
      A combine harvester brings all of them together, saving time, labour, and post-harvest losses.
    </p>

    <h2>Why Farmers in India Prefer Combine Harvesters</h2>
    <p>
      Indian harvesting windows can be tight. Weather shifts, labour availability, and rising input costs are common challenges.
      In real field use, farmers prefer combines because they help finish the job quickly and predictably.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Reduce dependency on seasonal labour</li>
      <li>Complete harvesting quickly before crop damage</li>
      <li>Lower grain losses compared to manual methods</li>
      <li>Improve grain cleanliness and overall sample quality</li>
      <li>Reduce the overall harvesting cost per acre in many situations</li>
    </ul>

    <div class="callout">
      <strong>Practical observation:</strong> Most grain quality complaints happen due to incorrect settings (drum speed, fan airflow,
      sieve openings) rather than the machine itself. A trained operator can improve output noticeably on the same field.
    </div>

    <h2>How Does a Combine Harvester Work? (Step-by-Step)</h2>
    <p>
      Understanding how a combine harvester works helps farmers use it efficiently and helps dealers guide buyers with the right expectations.
    </p>

    <h3>1) Cutting the Crop (Header Unit)</h3>
    <p>
      The front section, called the <strong>header</strong>, cuts the standing crop. It usually includes:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>A reel that guides the crop towards the cutter bar</li>
      <li>A cutter bar with blades that slice the crop at the required height</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Different crops often need different header setups (wheat/rice vs maize). Correct header height reduces unnecessary straw intake.
    </p>

    <h3>2) Feeding the Crop</h3>
    <p>
      Once cut, the crop is carried inside through a conveyor system. Smooth feeding matters—uneven feeding can reduce efficiency,
      increase grain damage, and overload the threshing unit.
    </p>
    <p>
      Operators in heavy crops usually slow down slightly and adjust reel speed to keep feeding uniform.
    </p>

    <h3>3) Threshing Process</h3>
    <p>
      This is the heart of the combine. The crop passes through a rotating drum or rotor where grains are separated from the stalk using
      impact and rubbing action.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>High drum speed can increase breakage in dry grain</li>
      <li>Low drum speed can leave unthreshed grain in the straw</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      In India, grain moisture varies by region and harvest timing—so matching settings to crop condition is a real advantage.
    </p>

    <h3>4) Separation of Grain and Straw</h3>
    <p>
      After threshing, grain falls through sieves while straw moves toward the rear. Depending on model and setup, straw may be spread evenly
      or left in rows.
    </p>

    <h3>5) Cleaning the Grain</h3>
    <p>
      A blower uses controlled airflow to remove light chaff and dust. Clean grain is collected into a grain tank.
      This step helps produce a cleaner sample for mandi and storage without extra manual cleaning.
    </p>

    <h3>6) Grain Storage and Unloading</h3>
    <p>
      When the grain tank fills, grain is unloaded using an auger into a trolley or trailer. This keeps harvesting continuous and reduces downtime.
    </p>

    <h2>Types of Combine Machines Used in India</h2>
    <p>Farmers typically choose based on crop pattern, soil condition, and field moisture:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Self-propelled combine harvesters</strong> – common choice for medium to large farms</li>
      <li><strong>Track-type combines</strong> – useful for wet paddy fields where wheels may sink</li>
      <li><strong>Wheel-type combines</strong> – preferred for drier fields and faster road movement</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Combine Harvester Price in India</h2>
    <p>
      <strong>Combine harvester price</strong> in India depends on the machine size, engine power, crop compatibility (single vs multi-crop),
      and whether it is track or wheel type. After-sales support and spare part availability also affect long-term ownership cost.
    </p>
    <p>
      As a general field-level range, many combine harvesters in India fall between <strong>₹18 lakh to ₹35 lakh</strong>, depending on configuration.
      Custom hiring operators often recover costs faster by offering harvesting services in nearby villages during season.
    </p>

    <h2>Maintenance Tips That Actually Reduce Breakdowns</h2>
    <p>
      Good maintenance is less about big repairs and more about daily discipline during harvest season.
      Farmers who follow these habits usually face fewer mid-season stoppages:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Clean sieves and air filters daily (dust builds up fast during peak harvest)</li>
      <li>Check belts, chains, and bearings regularly for heat and wear</li>
      <li>Adjust threshing and fan settings as crop moisture changes</li>
      <li>Use reliable spare parts to avoid repeat failures during peak season</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Local Perspective: Fieldking and Mechanised Harvesting in India</h2>
    <p>
      India’s farming conditions change every few kilometres—crop density, soil moisture, and harvesting schedules vary widely.
      In this environment, brands that understand local realities matter. <strong>Fieldking</strong> is known for designing farm equipment that
      aligns with Indian field conditions and practical usage patterns, which is exactly what farmers and dealers look for when mechanisation becomes a serious investment.
